# React-Reservator

A quick and simple NodeJS/GraphQL/React/Redux demo application.
[Demonstration Deployment](https://react-reservator.herokuapp.com/)

Note: Presently, the React client is being built out. I get about 15 minutes a day to write code that isn't for work, so the demo may or may not be up and running depending on where I last left off.
